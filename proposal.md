[Starting Intuition]
My original intuition was we are whitelisting instead of blacklisting by training a model with past benign behavior of employees for various reasons. 
Malicious events and their labels are very scarce in practice. Attacks are always evolving. Thus, training a model to catch malicious events with  already known attack is a losing battle. 

However, training a transformer model with benign behavior and catching malicious logs by flagging statistically deviated behavior has several problems.
First, transformer models are very bad at understanding tabular data which most enterprise logs are.
Second, transformer models are bad in learning statistically rare events when high density events dominate. This is worsened by tabular data input.

Thus we were thinking of using tree model to find what makes rare events as rare events and distill that knowledge to transformer.
First we find what event sequences are rare using n-gram and label them as high surprise events. Tree learns what makes low event as low events. By giving attention bias to the interactions mined from tree, transformer efficiently learn that they are benign even though the sample size is small.


[Research Proposal]
# **Symbolic Attention Guidance (SAG): Closing the Semantic Gap in Security Log Analysis via Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Distillation**

## **Research Proposal for IEEE S&P 2025**

## **1. Executive Summary**

We propose to develop Symbolic Attention Guidance (SAG), a novel neuro-symbolic framework that addresses the fundamental semantic gap in security anomaly detection. Current systems cannot distinguish between statistical rarity and semantic malice, causing overwhelming false positive rates. Our key innovation is a knowledge distillation pipeline that extracts symbolic reasoning from interpretable models and injects it as architectural bias into deep learning models, enabling them to learn semantically-aware representations. We will demonstrate that this approach can reduce false positives by >70% while maintaining detection accuracy, fundamentally changing the feasibility of ML-based security monitoring.

## **2. Problem Statement and Motivation**

### **2.1 The Semantic Gap Crisis**

Modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are drowning in false positives. A typical enterprise SOC receives 10,000+ alerts daily, with >99% being false positives [Ponemon Institute, 2023]. This isn't a tuning problem—it's a fundamental architectural limitation of current ML approaches.

The root cause is the **semantic gap**: the inability of statistical models to understand the operational context that determines whether an event is truly malicious. 

**[FIGURE 1 - The Semantic Gap Problem]**
*Caption: Draw a split diagram with two parallel scenarios at 3 AM:*
- *Top path: Administrator login → explorer.exe → powershell.exe → maintenance_script.ps1*
- *Bottom path: Employee opens email → outlook.exe → malicious.docx → winword.exe → powershell.exe → download_payload.ps1*
- *Both paths show "Statistical View: P(powershell at 3am) = 0.01% - RARE!"*
- *Add "Semantic View" labels: Top = "Benign (admin duty)", Bottom = "Malicious (suspicious parent)"*
- *Show current ML systems outputting "ANOMALY!" for both, while SAG correctly identifies only the bottom as malicious*

### **2.2 Formal Problem Definition**

Let an event sequence be **S = {e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ}** where each event **eᵢ = (aᵢ, cᵢ, tᵢ)** consists of:
- **aᵢ**: The action (e.g., process_creation, file_access)
- **cᵢ**: The context vector (user_role, parent_process, network_state)
- **tᵢ**: The timestamp

Current approaches model: **P(anomaly|S) ≈ P(rare|S)**

We need to model: **P(anomaly|S) = P(malicious|S, C, K)** where:
- **C**: Semantic context
- **K**: Domain knowledge

The challenge is that K exists in security expertise but current neural architectures have no mechanism to incorporate it.

### **2.3 Why This Problem Persists**

Despite years of research, the semantic gap persists because:

1. **Wrong Problem Formulation**: Research focuses on improving detection rates on benchmark datasets where attacks are statistically distinct, not addressing real-world semantic ambiguity

2. **Architectural Limitations**: Both classical and deep learning methods lack mechanisms to incorporate domain knowledge about what makes events semantically suspicious

3. **Evaluation Blindness**: Standard metrics (AUC-ROC, F1) don't capture the operational impact of false positives on rare-but-benign events

## **3. Related Work and Positioning**

### **3.1 Taxonomy of Current Approaches**

We categorize existing anomaly detection research along two critical dimensions: **context awareness** and **knowledge incorporation**.

**[Table 1: Positioning of Anomaly Detection Methods]**
| Method Class | Context Awareness | Knowledge Use | Key Limitation | FP Rate on Rare-Benign |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Statistical (IF, LOF, OC-SVM) | None | None | Context-blind, pure outlier detection | >95% |
| Sequential (DeepLog, LogAnomaly) | Local sequence | None | Learns "rare=bad" without semantic understanding | >80% |
| Contextual (Facade, LogRobust) | Learned implicit | None | Context learned from data, no domain expertise | >60% |
| Rule-Based (SIEM, Sigma) | Full | Explicit rules | Brittle, high maintenance, poor generalization | Varies |
| **SAG (Proposed)** | **Guided explicit** | **Distilled symbolic** | **Combines symbolic reasoning with neural flexibility** | **<20% (Target)** |

### **3.2 Classical Anomaly Detection**

**Statistical Methods** [Liu et al., 2008; Schölkopf et al., 2001]:
- **Mathematical Foundation**: These methods identify points x where p(x) < threshold
- **Critical Flaw**: No mechanism for incorporating context c in p(x|c)
- **3AM Example Impact**: Would flag all 3AM powershell executions equally

### **3.3 Deep Learning for Log Analysis**

**Sequential Modeling** [Du et al., 2017; Meng et al., 2019]:
- **DeepLog**: Models P(eₜ|eₜ₋₁, ..., eₜ₋ₙ) using LSTM
- **Strength**: Captures temporal dependencies
- **3AM Example Impact**: Learns that powershell at 3AM is rare but cannot learn that admin usage is acceptable

**Transformer-Based** [Guo et al., 2021; Le et al., 2022]:
- **LogBERT**: Attention mechanism with self-supervised pretraining
- **Mathematical Model**: Standard attention: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V
- **3AM Example Impact**: Better representations but still assigns high anomaly scores to both admin and malicious scenarios

### **3.4 Context-Aware Methods**

**Facade** [Alahmadi et al., USENIX'23]:
- **Innovation**: Contrastive learning with separate action and context encoders
- **Loss Function**: L = -log(exp(sim(a,c⁺))/Σexp(sim(a,c⁻)))
- **Limitation**: Context learned from data statistics, not semantic rules
- **3AM Example Impact**: Might learn admin patterns IF sufficient training examples exist, but fails on unseen rare-but-benign scenarios

### **3.5 The Gap We Address**

**[FIGURE 2 - SAG vs. Existing Approaches]**
*Caption: Draw a 2x2 matrix with axes "Context Awareness" (Low→High) and "Knowledge Incorporation" (None→Full):*
- *Bottom-left quadrant: Statistical methods (IF, OC-SVM)*
- *Bottom-right quadrant: Sequential (LSTM, BERT)*
- *Top-left quadrant: Rule-based (SIEM)*
- *Top-right quadrant: SAG (our contribution)*
- *Add arrows showing evolution of methods*
- *Highlight that only SAG achieves both high context awareness AND knowledge incorporation*

## **4. Proposed Research: Symbolic Attention Guidance**

### **4.1 Core Innovation and Architecture Overview**

Our key insight: **The knowledge to resolve semantic ambiguity exists in security expertise but current methods have no mechanism to inject it into neural architectures**. 

**[FIGURE 3 - SAG Architecture Overview]**
*Caption: Draw a four-stage pipeline flowing left to right:*
1. *Stage 1: "Log Stream + Semantic Features" box showing raw logs being enriched*
2. *Stage 2: "Symbolic Teacher (LightGBM)" learning tree with if-then rules*
3. *Stage 3: "Knowledge Distillation (TreeSHAP)" showing attention matrix B being extracted*
4. *Stage 4: "Guided Student (Transformer)" with modified attention mechanism*
- *Add the 3AM example flowing through each stage with annotations*
- *Show how admin scenario gets low attention weight while malicious gets high weight*

### **4.2 Technical Approach - Detailed Methodology**

#### **Phase 1: Symbolic Knowledge Encoding**

We encode domain knowledge as semantic features across three categories:

**Entity-State Features** (Properties of individual entities):
```python
user_is_admin = user.role in ['ADMIN', 'SYSTEM']
process_is_signed = verify_signature(process.binary)
file_is_critical = file.path in CRITICAL_PATHS
user_login_frequency = login_count(user, last_30_days)
```

**Relational Features** (Relationships between entities):
```python
parent_child_suspicious = risk_score(parent_process, child_process)
user_process_legitimate = is_authorized(user, process)
network_direction = classify_traffic(src_ip, dst_ip)  # internal/external
file_access_pattern = access_frequency(user, file)
```

**Temporal Features** (Time-based context):
```python
is_business_hours = time in [9:00-17:00] and day in [Mon-Fri]
is_maintenance_window = time in SCHEDULED_MAINTENANCE
days_since_last_seen = (current_time - last_occurrence).days
temporal_velocity = event_count(time_window) / window_size
```

**3AM Example Encoding**:
- Admin scenario: `{user_is_admin: True, parent_child_suspicious: 0.1, is_business_hours: False, is_maintenance_window: True}`
- Malicious scenario: `{user_is_admin: False, parent_child_suspicious: 0.9, is_business_hours: False, is_maintenance_window: False}`

#### **Phase 2: Symbolic Teacher Training**

The teacher learns to predict contextual surprise, defined as:

**S(eₜ) = -log P(eₜ | e₁, ..., eₜ₋₁, F)**

Where F is our semantic feature vector. We use LightGBM because gradient-boosted trees naturally learn interpretable rules:

```python
def train_symbolic_teacher(sequences, features):
    # Step 1: Train n-gram model for base surprise scores
    ngram_model = NgramLanguageModel(n=5)
    ngram_model.fit(sequences)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate surprise scores as targets
    targets = []
    for seq in sequences:
        for t, event in enumerate(seq):
            context = seq[max(0,t-n):t]
            surprise = -log(ngram_model.predict_proba(event|context))
            targets.append(surprise)
    
    # Step 3: Train LightGBM to predict surprise from semantic features
    teacher = LightGBM(
        objective='regression',
        num_leaves=31,
        learning_rate=0.05,
        feature_fraction=0.9
    )
    teacher.fit(features, targets)
    return teacher
```

**Learned Symbolic Rules for 3AM Example**:
```
IF is_business_hours=False AND user_is_admin=False AND parent_process="winword.exe" 
    THEN surprise=HIGH (malicious)

IF is_business_hours=False AND user_is_admin=True AND is_maintenance_window=True
    THEN surprise=LOW (benign exception)
```

#### **Phase 3: Knowledge Distillation via TreeSHAP**

We distill the teacher's symbolic knowledge into an attention bias matrix:

**[ALGORITHM 1 - Attention Bias Distillation]**
```python
def distill_attention_bias(teacher, sequence, features):
    L = len(sequence)
    B = np.zeros((L, L))  # L×L attention bias matrix
    
    for i in range(L):  # For each target position
        # Get teacher's prediction for position i
        target_features = features[i]
        predicted_surprise = teacher.predict(target_features)
        
        # Use TreeSHAP to explain prediction
        explainer = TreeSHAP(teacher)
        
        for j in range(L):  # For each context position
            # Calculate importance of position j for predicting position i
            context_features = features[j]
            shap_value = explainer.shap_values(
                context_features, 
                target=predicted_surprise
            )
            B[i,j] = aggregate_shap_importance(shap_value)
    
    return B
```

**Complexity Analysis**: O(L² × T × F) where L=sequence length, T=trees in ensemble, F=features. This is computationally intensive but performed offline once per training sequence.

**[FIGURE 4 - Attention Bias Matrix Visualization]**
*Caption: Draw a heatmap showing the L×L bias matrix for the 3AM example:*
- *X-axis: Context positions (e₁...eₙ)*
- *Y-axis: Target positions (e₁...eₙ)*
- *Color intensity: Importance (blue=low, red=high)*
- *Highlight: For admin sequence, powershell position has low importance from all contexts*
- *Highlight: For malicious sequence, winword.exe→powershell has high importance*

#### **Phase 4: Guided Student Architecture**

The student is a transformer with modified attention incorporating symbolic guidance:

```python
class SymbolicGuidedAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, n_heads, lambda_guidance=0.5):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.n_heads = n_heads
        self.lambda_guidance = lambda_guidance
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
    
    def forward(self, x, bias_matrix):
        batch_size, seq_len, _ = x.shape
        
        # Standard attention components
        Q = self.W_q(x).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.n_heads, -1)
        K = self.W_k(x).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.n_heads, -1)
        V = self.W_v(x).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.n_heads, -1)
        
        # Calculate attention scores
        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(self.d_model)
        
        # Inject symbolic guidance
        guided_scores = scores + self.lambda_guidance * bias_matrix.unsqueeze(1)
        
        # Apply softmax and compute output
        attention_weights = F.softmax(guided_scores, dim=-1)
        output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, V)
        
        return output, attention_weights
```

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
AttentionSAG(Q,K,V,B) = softmax((QKᵀ/√dk) + λB)V
```

Where λ controls the strength of symbolic guidance.

### **4.3 Why This Architecture Works: The 3AM Example Walkthrough**

Let's trace how SAG handles our motivating example:

**[FIGURE 5 - SAG Processing Pipeline for 3AM Example]**
*Caption: Draw two parallel flowcharts showing admin vs malicious processing:*
- *Top flow (Admin): Show semantic features extracted → Teacher assigns LOW surprise → Bias matrix has low weights → Student learns this is normal*
- *Bottom flow (Malicious): Show semantic features extracted → Teacher assigns HIGH surprise → Bias matrix has high weights → Student learns this is anomalous*
- *Include actual feature values and attention weights at each stage*

**Step-by-step Processing**:

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Admin: `{user_is_admin: 1, parent="explorer.exe", maintenance_window: 1}`
   - Malicious: `{user_is_admin: 0, parent="winword.exe", maintenance_window: 0}`

2. **Teacher Prediction**:
   - Admin: S(e) = 2.1 (low surprise - matches learned rule for admin maintenance)
   - Malicious: S(e) = 8.7 (high surprise - matches malicious pattern)

3. **Attention Bias**:
   - Admin: B[powershell, *] ≈ 0.1 (low importance to sequence)
   - Malicious: B[powershell, winword] ≈ 0.9 (high importance)

4. **Student Learning**:
   - Admin sequence: Low attention weight → Learned as normal
   - Malicious sequence: High attention weight → Learned as anomalous

## **5. Experimental Plan**

### **5.1 Datasets and Preprocessing**

**Primary Datasets:**
- **LANL Unified Host and Network**: 1.6B events, 58 days, real APT attacks
- **DARPA Transparent Computing**: 2.5B events, controlled red team exercises  
- **CERT Insider Threat v6.2**: Synthetic but realistic insider scenarios

**Preprocessing Pipeline:**
```python
def preprocess_logs(raw_logs):
    # 1. Parse and normalize
    events = parse_raw_logs(raw_logs)
    
    # 2. Extract semantic features
    for event in events:
        event.features = extract_semantic_features(event)
    
    # 3. Reconstruct sessions
    sessions = reconstruct_sessions(events, timeout=30*60)
    
    # 4. Window sequences
    sequences = create_sliding_windows(sessions, window_size=100)
    
    return sequences, features
```

### **5.2 Baseline Comparisons**

**[Table 2: Comprehensive Baseline Evaluation Plan]**
| Category | Method | Implementation | Expected Performance on 3AM Test |
|----------|--------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Classical | Isolation Forest | sklearn | FPR >95% (flags all rare) |
| Classical | One-Class SVM | sklearn | FPR >95% (flags all rare) |
| Sequential | DeepLog | LSTM, next-event | FPR >80% (rare = anomalous) |
| Sequential | LogAnomaly | Template+LSTM | FPR >75% (slight improvement) |
| Transformer | LogBERT | BERT-base | FPR >60% (better but still high) |
| SOTA | Facade | Contrastive learning | FPR >40% (context helps partially) |
| **Ours** | **SAG** | **Guided Transformer** | **FPR <20% (target)** |

### **5.3 Novel Evaluation: Semantic Disambiguation Test**

We propose a new benchmark specifically designed to test semantic understanding:

**Test Set Construction:**
```python
def generate_semantic_disambiguation_test():
    test_cases = []
    
    # Category 1: Admin activities at unusual times
    for hour in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:  # 1-5 AM
        benign = create_sequence(
            user="ADMIN_001",
            actions=["login", "explorer.exe", "powershell.exe", "backup.ps1"],
            time=f"{hour:02d}:00",
            label=0  # benign
        )
        test_cases.append(benign)
    
    # Category 2: Matched malicious activities
    for hour in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
        malicious = create_sequence(
            user="CLERK_447",
            actions=["email_open", "winword.exe", "powershell.exe", "download.ps1"],
            time=f"{hour:02d}:00",
            label=1  # malicious
        )
        test_cases.append(malicious)
    
    # Category 3: Rare but legitimate developer activities
    benign_dev = create_sequence(
        user="DEV_023",
        actions=["git.exe", "python.exe", "debug_tool.exe"],
        time="weekend",
        label=0
    )
    test_cases.append(benign_dev)
    
    return test_cases
```

**Success Metrics:**
- **Precision on rare-but-benign**: % of rare benign correctly classified
- **Recall on semantically similar attacks**: % of attacks detected
- **Semantic F1**: Harmonic mean of above

**Hypotheses:**
- **H1**: SAG achieves >90% precision on rare-but-benign (vs <10% for baselines)
- **H2**: SAG maintains >95% recall on malicious variants
- **H3**: SAG reduces overall FPR by >70% compared to best baseline

### **5.4 Ablation Studies**

To validate each component's contribution:

**[Table 3: Ablation Study Design]**
| Configuration | Description | Purpose | Expected Impact |

| SAG-RandomBias | B = random matrix | Test specific knowledge | +50% FPR |
| SAG-DirectFeatures | Features as input only | Test distillation value | +25% FPR |
| SAG-NoTeacher | Skip teacher, direct bias | Test teacher importance | +30% FPR |

### **5.5 Computational and Scalability Analysis**

        },
        'scalability': {
            'vs_sequence_length': benchmark_varying_L(),
            'vs_feature_count': benchmark_varying_F()
        }
    }
    return metrics
```

# Synthetic 3AM test (1000 sequences)
Results:

## **10. Broader Vision and Future Work**

### **10.1 Immediate Extensions**
- **Dynamic Bias Learning**: Online updates to bias matrices as new patterns emerge
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Extend to network traffic, system calls, and application logs
- **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving deployment across organizations

### **10.2 Generalization to Other Domains**
The SAG framework generalizes to any domain with:
- Expert knowledge about exceptions
- High cost of false positives
- Semantic context determining legitimacy

**Potential Applications:**
- **Financial Fraud**: Distinguishing unusual but legitimate transactions
- **Healthcare**: Identifying clinical anomalies vs. rare conditions
- **Industrial IoT**: Separating maintenance from malfunction

### **10.3 Long-term Vision**
SAG represents a paradigm shift from "learning from data" to "learning from knowledge." Success would establish a new research direction in security ML where human expertise is systematically encoded and transferred to neural architectures, making AI systems more trustworthy and deployable in critical infrastructure.

## **11. Conclusion**

The semantic gap has rendered current anomaly detection systems operationally ineffective, with false positive rates exceeding 99% in production deployments. We propose Symbolic Attention Guidance, a novel neuro-symbolic framework that bridges this gap by distilling expert knowledge into neural architectures through attention bias matrices. 

Our approach uniquely combines:
1. **Symbolic reasoning** from interpretable tree models
2. **Neural flexibility** from transformer architectures  
3. **Domain expertise** through semantic feature engineering
4. **Prescriptive guidance** via attention mechanism modification

We expect to demonstrate:
- **>70% reduction** in false positives on rare-but-benign events
- **>90% precision** on semantic disambiguation tests
- **<2% degradation** in true positive rate
- **Interpretable rules** for every detection

This work will make ML-based security monitoring finally practical for real-world deployment, while establishing a generalizable framework for injecting domain knowledge into deep learning systems.
